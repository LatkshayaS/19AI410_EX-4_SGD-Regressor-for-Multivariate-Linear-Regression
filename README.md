# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1.Load the dataset from the CSV file, select R&D Spend as the independent variable and Profit as the dependent variable, and apply feature scaling to the input data.

2.Initialize the model parameters (weight and bias), learning rate, number of epochs, and prepare a list to store loss values.

3.For each epoch, compute predicted values, calculate the Mean Squared Error, determine gradients, and update the weight and bias using gradient descent.

4.Plot the loss versus iterations and the regression line with the data points, and display the final weight and bias values.
